        <p>BuyDomains.com offers domain registration at a competitive price.  Customers can register domains one at a time, or via our bulk registration feature.  BuyDomains.com offers domain registration at a third of the cost of Network Solutions.  If the domain you have chosen is already reserved, BuyDomains.com can offer suggestions for similarly named domains from our collection of Premium Domains, or available names. Domain registrations can be acquired for periods as long as 10 years.</p>


        <p>Its easy to transfer domain names to BuyDomains.com and receive our entire suite of value added services at no extra charge.  Every domain transfer comes with a one year extension to your current expiration date, URL forwarding, unlimited email forwarding, full featured domain nameserver service (DNS) and toll free support.  Domain transfers can be acquired for periods as long as 8 years.</p>


        <p>Buydomains.com offers three competitive packages for website hosting. The elite web hosting package offers a large amount of storage, many email accounts and a sophisticated ready-made e-commerce capability. The standard web hosting package offers a streamlined approach for smaller information based websites.</p>


        <p>Domain names are similar to stocks that can have initial public offerings and then be sold in secondary markets at different (usually greater) prices. Getting in on the "IPO" (initial domain registration) of a prominent sounding Internet name is the best method to secure a domain name at a low price that is likely to continuously increase in value. Unfortunately, the best domain names are long gone so it is unlikely that most new domain registrations will have dramatic increases in value. Fortunately, many names can be purchased via secondary markets.</p>


        <p>BuyDomains.com is a brokerage for the very best unused Internet names. And, for the most part, the costs of domain names at our market are vastly lower than similar names that are offered elsewhere. A company or individual may want to buy some of our names to start a new e-commerce website, to use for an existing business, or to speculate that the names are (or will be) worth more than BuyDomains.com's quoted price.</p>
